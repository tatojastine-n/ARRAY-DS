# ARRAY-DS 
•	This code provides an easy way to reverse a list of numbers, such as changing [1, 2, 3] to [3, 2, 1]. In the main function, it reads from input: the first line gives the array size (e.g., "3"), which gets trimmed of leading spaces via ltrim and converted to an int. The second line has the numbers (e.g., "1 2 3"), trimmed at the end with rtrim, split into parts, and stored as integers in a vector. The reverseArray function simply uses std::reverse from the algorithm library to flip the vector in one efficient pass by swapping elements from both ends. Then, main outputs the result to a file via the OUTPUT_PATH variable, with spaces between numbers and a final newline—ideal for online testing. The helper functions handle extra spaces reliably, making it a solid intro to vectors, input parsing, and basic algorithms without unnecessary complexity.
