# ARRAY-DS 
This program takes a list of integers as input and returns the list in reverse order. The `reverseArray` function makes a copy of the input list, uses the built-in `Reverse()` method to flip the order of the elements, and then returns it. In the `Main` method, the program reads the list from the user, calls the function, and prints the reversed list as the output.
